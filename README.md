# We Are Family: The Influence of Household Composition on Wealth
The shifting demographics in Latin America present several challenges, including an increasing reliance on household wealth. Household composition directly influences the magnitude of this dependence because savings potential is contingent upon the number of dependents. This paper employs instrumental variables in exploring the causal relationship between the number of children and household
wealth scores in six Latin American countries. Using household surveys for countries across different stages of development, we find that an additional child is associated with a decrease in the household wealth score of 18 to 20 percentage points in high-income Latin American countries. The evidence thus suggests that the negative impacts are more pronounced as countries move upward in development levels.
