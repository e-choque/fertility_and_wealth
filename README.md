# Fertility and Wealth. A causal evidence for Latin American Countries
This article uses an IV regression to find a causal association between fertility
and household wealth in six Latin American countries. We use the Demographic
Household Survey (DHS) database available for two periods of recollections (2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2013). We applied two econometrics models, each of which
uses a different instrument. The first uses infertility shock proposed by Aguero and
Marks (2011) and the second applies the twinâ€™s method developed by ANGRIST and
EVANS (1998). The results set up that the more the income per capita of the country
is, the more the fertility negative impact is over the distribution of wealth index. This
interesting result keeps similar if we apply the econometrics models to the second
period (2010-2013).
